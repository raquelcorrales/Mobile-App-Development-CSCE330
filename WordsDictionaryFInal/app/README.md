This project contains the code that I dicussed on Thursday. You should be able to run this app.

Review all this code, but be sure to review the comments in the code in screens/add package.

Use this project as a reference as well as the MarsRealEstate and TrackMySleepQuality projects.

You will need to set the API_KEY in the APIService.kt file before running it.

The add word menu navigates to the search word fragment. From there, you can search for a word.

It only handles exact matches (i.e. API response == "[{"]). On a match, it navigates to the add word fragment.

There are other classes in the project that are defined but not in use it. There are some unit and instrumented tests as well.

As you work through building the app, focus on completing one flow at a time. For example, search for a word and save it to the database. Then work on displaying the words in the overview screen in a recycler view.

Let me know if you have any questions.
