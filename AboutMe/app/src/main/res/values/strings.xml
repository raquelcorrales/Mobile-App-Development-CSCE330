    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Raquel.
    \n\nI am an international student from Costa Rica.
    I am in North Central College as a part of an exchange student program.
    \n\n Fun fact is that I love sports, I use to practice triathlon.
    \n\n I like the food here, even if it is different from what I used to eat in my home
    \n\n The most difficult part of this experience it\'s been the cold
    because I come from a tropical country where the temperatures are higher than here,
        for example my country is usually 23Â°C \n\n</string>
